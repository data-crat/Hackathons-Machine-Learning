Have you ever organized your clothes in a way that the clothes pertaining to the same occasion are in the same racks or same block? You most likely have. You already know about grouping similar objects together.

While the idea is drastically simple, the amount of use cases influenced by this idea is enormous. In machine learning literature, this is often referred to as clustering - automatically grouping similar objects to the same groups.


We are going to take a look at the old faithful K-Means clustering algorithm which has impacted a very huge number of applications in a wide variety of domains. We will start off by building the general notion of clustering and some of the rules that govern it. We will review some of the different types of clustering briefly and then we will dive into the nitty gritty details of  K-Means. We’ll conclude this article by seeing K-Means in action in Python using a supermart dataset.

By the time you are done, you’ll have working knowledge of the algorithm and can start applying it to your own use cases.

Sounds interesting?
