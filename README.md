# 1) Big Mart Sales - 
My take on Analytics Vidhya BigMartâ€™s sale(https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/) 
prediction hackathon.
We have  to identify the most important variables and to define the best regression model for predicting 
out response variable.
Hence, this analysis will be divided into five stages:

The Algorithms aren't covered in an extensive way as it assumes the user to know the maths behind them.
Please visit the REGRESSION folder for the code.

My Score on Analytics Vidhya:
1) Linear Regression : RMSE :1262
2) Decision Tree:      RMSE :1302
3) XGBoost:            RMSE : 955.8

It got me into top 20% of the leaderboard.

# 2) Customer Segmentation-
  My take on understanding Unsupervised ML and specifically introduction and implementation of clustering algorithms
  
  # We will dwell in to the unsupervised aspect of machine learning in this section


   
  Unsupervised learning is the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm using information that is neither classified     nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance



  # Pretty interesting right????

  Please go to the clustering folder for the code written in jupyter notebook and the dataset used for the same.
