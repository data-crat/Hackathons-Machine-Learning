# 1) Big Mart Sales - 
My take on Analytics Vidhya BigMartâ€™s sale(https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/) 
prediction hackathon.
We have  to identify the most important variables and to define the best regression model for predicting 
out response variable.
Hence, this analysis will be divided into five stages:

The Algorithms aren't covered in an extensive way as it assumes the user to know the maths behind them.
Please visit the Big Mart Sales Sales folder for the self explanatory code and the dataset used

# 2) Customer Segmentation-
  My take on understanding Unsupervised ML and specifically introduction and implementation of clustering algorithms
  
  # We will dwell in to the unsupervised aspect of machine learning in this section


   
  Unsupervised learning is the training of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm using information that is neither classified     nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance



  # Pretty interesting right????   
  
  ![unsupervised](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45167372/74805633-b08c0980-5309-11ea-88bc-8b9f492db0c3.gif)
  
  
  Please go to the clustering folder for the code written in jupyter notebook and the dataset used for the same.

# 3) Market Mix Modelling-
  My take on market mix modelling concepts and modelling techniques
  
  # We will dwell in to  how four P's vary with each other, explain the model together and how can they solve problems for the organizations

  Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is one of the most popular analysis under Marketing Analytics which helps organisations in estimating the   effects of spent on different advertising channels (TV, Radio, Print, Online Ads etc) as well as other factors (price, competition,     weather, inflation, unemployment) on sales. In simple words, it helps companies in optimizing their marketing investments which they     spent in different marketing mediums (both online and offline).
  
  Please visit the Market-Mix-Modelling folder for the self explanatory code and the dataset used.
  
  
  
  
  
  
 # Many Many more to be added to the list. May the data be with you.
